        <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h3>
          <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month!<br >
            I went with a friend and we were able to see many things<br >
            while we were there!</p>
      </div>
        <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
          <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away.<br >
             Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!)<br >
             We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em>.</p>

        <h4 id="day2">Day 2</h4>
          <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>.<br >
             Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br >
             <br >
             After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places!<br >
             We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate<br >
             all of the best macarons the city had to offer.<br >
             After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>.</p>

        <h4 id="day3">Day 3</h4>
          <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge!<br >
             We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet,<br >
             and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised<br >
             to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those<br >
             by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
